After several years of working as a translator, from English and Japanese to Spanish, I decided to start speaking the language of computers and became a web developer. To that end, I completed the Web Development bootcamp at Ironhack Barcelona. I am constantly studying and building up my skills as a web developer.

Technologies: Javascript, HTML & CSS, React, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB.
